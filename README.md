# Basic-MesaageSender-App-Android
It is an basic Message sender Android app which displays the all available options to send message when Send is clicked by using Intent  
In this App I disabled Dark Mode and changed the color of Status Bar..
And Changed the Status bar Icon Color using         decor.setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LIGHT_STATUS_BAR); it sets the color suitalbe for light colored status bar


And I had used lottie Animations
